# Contacts App

This project is the continuation of a learning process that I was doing, It's going to have tests and some other dependencies that I'll add in a future.

## Run the app

To do this, you have to run the following command:

``` bash
./mvnw spring-boot:run
```

## Package the app

If you want to generate a .jar of the project, please run this command:

``` bash
./mvnw clean package
```

### And if you have to run the .jar...

You can also run that with:

``` bash
java -jar target/contacts-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar 
```
